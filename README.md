A short project by Bene Skirde to measure plant health via impedance using a NanoVNA

# Report on Sensing

[This paper](https://github.com/PubInv/botanical-impedance-sensing/blob/main/EmbeddedBotanicalSensors.pdf) is a summary of 
our attempt to sense plant health using a NanoVNA to measure impedance. It was written by Bene Skirde under the 
supervision of Robert L. Read with help from Lawrence Kincheloe.

Bene gave a [YouTube presentation](https://youtu.be/aUDcoj98lj0) at our Monthly Inventors' Gathering.
